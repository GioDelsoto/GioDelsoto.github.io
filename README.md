# Giovanni Sim√µes Delsoto - Data Scientist

## üëã About Me

Good morning, dear reader! Allow me to introduce myself :)

My name is Giovanni, and I‚Äôm a data scientist driven by curiosity and a passion for exploring the world. With a background in Mechanical Engineering and expertise in applied statistics, mathematical modeling, and system optimization, I discovered in data an incredible tool to turn ideas into real impact.

Beyond data science, my love for learning spans everything from quantum mechanics to neuroscience ‚Äì I enjoy understanding how things work. I‚Äôm also a violinist and singer in my spare time, as music holds a special place in my heart. When I found the world of data, I realized it was my calling. The ability to apply data science to everything I‚Äôm passionate about, from analyzing music to developing impactful projects, left me truly fascinated.

I invite you to explore some of the projects I‚Äôve worked on, and if you‚Äôre interested, feel free to reach out! I‚Äôm always on the lookout for opportunities to create meaningful impact.

## üìä Data Science Projects

- **[Churn Prediction for Telecom](https://github.com/GioDelsoto/NLP-projects)**: Developed a predictive model to identify at-risk customers and simulated a retention strategy (discount) to **maximize profit**.
  
- **[Spark Project to Predict Airfoil Noise](https://github.com/GioDelsoto/Spark-Project)**: Created a project using **PySpark** and linear regression to predict airfoil noise.

- **[ETL Project](https://github.com/GioDelsoto/ETL_and_data_analysis)**: Built a full **ETL pipeline** using **Airflow** to extract order data, update customer and product lists in a **PostgreSQL database**. This data is used for cohort analysis, repurchase predictions, and feeding machine learning models.

- **[Market Prediction Project](https://github.com/GioDelsoto/StockMarket)**: Aimed to learn about stock market predictions and trading strategies. Although I didn't achieve a strong model for short-term price prediction, I achieved good precision for long-term predictions using an SVM classification method. With this model and a risk management strategy, simulations showed it to be efficient.

- **[Employee Tenure Prediction](https://github.com/GioDelsoto/Tenure-prediction)**: Forecasted employee tenure using classification techniques based on historical data. Used **K-means clustering** to predict the reason for employees leaving the company.

- **[Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/GioDelsoto/HeartDisease)**: Created a predictive model using clinical data and deployed it through a simple web app with **Flask**, allowing doctors to input patient data and view the probability of heart disease.

- **[LLM Fine-Tuning: Tweets Disaster Classification](https://github.com/GioDelsoto/Disaster-tweets-classification)**: Developed a model to predict whether a tweet corresponds to a disaster or not, using **BERT fine-tuning**.

- **[Cool NLP Projects](https://github.com/GioDelsoto/NLP-projects)**: Worked on various NLP projects to learn new techniques, including:
  
  1. **Transformer - nano-gpt**: Applied a **transformer architecture** to create a character-based text generator, trained on Shakespeare's texts.
  
  2. **RNN Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Implemented an **LSTM recurrent neural network** to predict the parts of speech for words in a text.
  
  3. **Cipher Decrypt**: Used a Markov transition model to discover the character mapping in an encrypted message. A **genetic algorithm** was employed to find the mapping that maximized the likelihood of the decrypted message.
  
  4. **Spam Detector**: Used **TF-IDF** and **Naive Bayes** for spam detection and compared with a model using **Latent Semantic Analysis** for dimensionality reduction.
  
  5. **Sentiment Analysis**: Applied **logistic regression** to classify the sentiment of tweets related to an airline company.
  
  6. **TextRank Summarization**: Implemented the **PageRank technique** to rank sentences by importance, using the Markov matrix and eigenvector calculations to determine the most significant sentences.
  
  7. **Movie Recommendation System**: Used the **nearest neighbors** algorithm to recommend movies based on their descriptions.
